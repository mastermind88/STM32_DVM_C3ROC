# STM32_DVM_C3ROC

This is a fork of the STM32 DVM V4 from Scott Zimmerman / Repeater Builder
Inspired from a similar design: github.com/wojciechk8/MMDVM_pog
Low-pass filter design by SQ6POG

I design a new KiCad Design with some improvements and seperate Display an LED Board,
mainly for use for use on Chaos Computer Clubs Radio Teams (c3roc) DMR repeaters

Components for easy source by some protototyp manufactors.
