# STM32_DVM_C3ROC

This is a fork of the STM32 DVM V4 from Scott Zimmerman N3XCC / Repeater Builder
Inspired from a similar design: github.com/wojciechk8/MMDVM_pog
Low-pass filter design by SQ6POG

I design a new KiCad Design with some improvements and separate LED Board with I2C and RS232 Display connections. Also with an 5V 3.5A DC/DC converter with TI TPS54360(B) for the Raspberry PI, so that can powered from the radios DC voltage. Also add some ferrite beads and USBCL6 TVS protection. Connection to the LED/Display is a 20 Pin ribbon cable.

This project is mainly design for use for use on Chaos Computer Clubs Radio Teams (c3roc) DMR repeaters. All credits go to first designers. May be some others HAMs find this useful and feel free to use.

PCB and Components can be easy source by some prototype manufactures.
